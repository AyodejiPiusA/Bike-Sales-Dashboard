Bike Sales Dashboard Project
Project Overview
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze bike sales data. It visualizes key customer demographics and behaviors to determine the factors that influence bike purchasing decisions. The dashboard allows users to filter data to explore trends across different regions, education levels, and marital statuses.

 Tools Used
 * Microsoft Excel  
 * Data Cleaning & Formatting  
 * Pivot Tables  
 * Interactive Dashboards (Slicers & Charts)

 Dashboard Interaction
The dashboard features Slicers on the left-hand side, allowing users to filter the visual data by:
	 * Marital Status: (Married, Single) 
	* Region: (Europe, North America, Pacific) 
	* Education: (Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, etc.) 
	* Home Owner: (Yes, No).

Key Insights
 The following patterns emerged:
	 * Income Influences Purchase: There is a direct correlation between higher income and bike purchases. Across both genders, customers who purchased a bike had a higher 	average income than those who did not. This suggests that the product may be viewed as a premium item or a discretionary expense. 
	* The "Middle Age" demographic contributes to the vast majority of sales. Sales volume drops significantly for both "Adolescents" and "Old" customers, indicating that 	the product appeals most to working-age adults (likely 30–55 years old).
	 * Commute Distance is a Deciding Factor: Customers with short commutes (0–1 Miles) are the most likely to buy a bike. As commute distance increases to 5+ miles, the 	likelihood of a purchase drops sharply, suggesting customers primarily view bikes as a viable transportation option for short trips rather than long-distance travel.

Business Recommendations
To improve sales performance, the following strategies are recommended: 
	* Target High-Income & Middle Aged Demographics:  
		 * Marketing campaigns should be heavily focused on the Middle Age bracket, as they are the volume drivers.  
		 * Given the income disparity between buyers and non-buyers, ads could feature premium models or emphasize quality and durability to appeal to higher-		income earners.
	 * Focus on Urban/Short-Commute Areas:  
		 * Ad spend should be prioritized in geographical areas with high population density where commutes are likely to be under 1 mile.  
		 * Marketing messaging should emphasize "convenience," "beating traffic," and "last-mile connectivity." 
	 * Gender Specific Marketing:
		 * While both genders follow similar trends, male buyers have a higher income threshold. Marketing to men might focus more on technical specs and 		premium features, whereas marketing to women (where the income gap is smaller) could focus on practicality and value.
